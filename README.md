# hello-world
Trying to learn here!

Failbot-2 here. 
New to this whole code thing. 
It seems like there won't be much of a future for people who don't have at least some knowledge of coding. 
I see my mother struggle with technology all the time and I refuse to end up like that when I get older. 
So I'm going to keep learning as much as I can. 
The future is coming, and I just want to make sure I have a piece of it.
